        <h3>FLW's picks for the 5 best modern PC and Mobile games to play right now.</h3>

        <span>By FLW STAFF| UPDATED:oct 24,2023 8:55AM| POSTED: OCT 24,2023 10:00AM</span>

        <p>The PC gaming landscape has shifted in recent years, both in terms of technological advancements in graphics
            cards and gaming PCs and in the makeup of FLW's PC gaming staff and contributors. As a result, outside of
            some real stalwarts, our list of the best modern PC games is substantially different compared to years past.
            <br><br>To be clear, this list does not attempt to pick out the “best” or “most influential” PC games ever
            made. It's also not a list of the most popular games out there, or a list that seeks to represent the top
            games of every genre. No, this is a list of 5 games that we, the FLW editors and contributors, collectively
            recommend the most, based on our tastes, and all from within the past 10 years. Though that doesn't mean we
            don't still recommend playing Baldur's Gate 3 right now.

            <h3>5. Final Fantasy XIV Online</h3>
            <article>
                <p>In short, Final Fantasy XIV is not just the best MMO you can play right now, it's a fantastic Final
                    Fantasy game in its own right. Through its relaunch and subsequent four expansions, FFXIV has slowly
                    morphed from a relatively generic good-versus-evil plot into a sprawling, political, and fantastical
                    thriller. The latest expansion, Endwalker, brings a satisfying conclusion to the game's now 8+ year
                    storyline, returning some familiar faces, settling old scores, and of course saving the world from
                    the greatest calamity yet. <br>Don't be scared away by the fact that it's online. Despite being an
                    MMO, Square-Enix has streamlined things so much that, if you don't want to, you really don't have to
                    play with other people. Story missions are intended to be tackled solo, and even instanced dungeons
                    now have an option for you to enter with computer-controlled party members instead of forcing you
                    into a group with strangers. Of course, it's also a fully-fleshed MMO with end-game raiding that
                    ranges from totally accessible to maddeningly punishing.</p>

            <h3>4. Hades</h3>
            <article>
                <p>Hades is the current gold standard of the roguelite genre, and it isn't even close. From its
                    exhilarating combat, to its incredible soundtrack, to its clever and well written narrative with
                    characters that seemingly never run out of meaningful things to say, all the way to its deep and
                    innovative post game that keeps you wanting to come back for more even after beating the last boss.
                    <br> Hades is incredibly difficult, but it never feels punishing in defeat. Dying is part of the
                    game, and actually comes with its own rewards in the form of new conversations with its fascinating
                    cast of characters, new opportunities to purchase game changing upgrades, and an opportunity for a
                    brand new run with a completely new set of godly boons that dramatically alter how you approach
                    combat. Hades is a masterclass of roguelite design, and just another example of how Supergiant Games
                    just doesn't miss. <br>A sequel, Hades 2, was announced at The Game Awards. Hades 2 will enter Early
                    Access exclusively on Steam and Epic Games Store in Q2 2024.

            <h3>3. Crusader Kings 3</h3>
            <article>
                <p>While historical strategy games are perhaps most known for their maddeningly complex systems so dense
                    they're near impenetrable, they're also about the human stories that emerge when great figures
                    collide. Crusader Kings 3 gives you many ways to tell those stories, be it overwhelming military
                    might, the diplomacy of a well-placed betrothal, or ending your enemies with a cloak-and-dagger
                    plot. <br>CK3 also manages to make these dense systems as accessible as they've ever been, with a
                    robust nested tooltip system that helps allow even strategy newcomers enjoy the game's complexity.
                    The latest expansion, Royal Court, adds a zoomed-in physical space where your ruler can look their
                    subjects in the eye, passing down individual judgements in addition to making realm-wide decrees.
                    The expansion also weaves an intricate overhauled culture system throughout the game, giving you
                    more opportunities to make your empire feel unique, with all the benefits and penalties that
                    entails.</p>

            <h3>2. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</h3>
            <article>
                <p>Deep, lengthy RPGs are a staple of PC gaming, and very few have put a larger chunk of sophisticated
                    content forward than The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt has. Its massive sandbox open-world areas impress,
                    both in terms of scope and density; they're generously dotted with great monsters to slay,
                    tantalizing mysteries to solve, and personal stories to unfurl. <br>It's also one of the most
                    impressive overall productions in gaming history, with reams of excellently written dialogue
                    performed by a stellar voice cast, an incredible original soundtrack, and graphics that qualify as
                    both a technical and artistic achievement. <br>CD Projekt Red is working on a new Witcher trilogy,
                    as well as an Unreal Engine 5 remake of The Witcher 1.</p>

        <section id="Half-Life">
            <h3>1. Half-Life: Alyx</h3>
            <article>
                <p>Valve's first Half-Life game in 13 years reminded us of the signature innovation that's made this
                    series so special, and why its return was so anticipated. Just as the first Half-Life proved you
                    could tell a compelling story in a first-person game without taking control of the camera away, and
                    Half-Life 2 pioneered physics-based puzzles and combat, Half-Life: Alyx set a new standard for
                    polish in virtual reality shooters and is a truly unique experience. It's so impressive, in fact,
                    that we believe fully justifies investing in a VR headset for your PC if you haven't already
                    (especially now that a Meta Quest 2 can be had for $300 and connects to your PC wirelessly via Air
                    Link). <br> Alyx's full-length campaign pulls out all the stops for an amazing and horrifying battle
                    against aliens and zombies where the simple act of reloading your weapon becomes a desperate
                    life-or-death struggle as headcrabs leap toward your actual face. Other VR games have great
                    shooting, but even more than a year later nothing has yet matched Valve's level of detail. Clever
                    three-dimensional puzzles and excellent and often funny performances from its cast break up the
                    action, and it's all capped off with a fantastic ending that made the decade-plus we had to wait for
                    the third coming of Half-Life almost feel worth it.</p>
